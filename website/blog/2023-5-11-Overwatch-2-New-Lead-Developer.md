# Prompt

You are now the lead developer of Overwatch, what changes do you make?

<!--truncate-->

## Battlepass reworks

Earning a new battlepass tier has the same animation as lootbox openings with an additional coin being added for each additional cosmetic in the tier.

![Lootbox Opening Image](https://2static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/51/59/51599c_5953252.jpg)

Battlepass grants 4 cosmetics every level up.

Every tier has both premium and free rewards.

### New Battlepass: Legacy Pass

[![Fortnite Legacy Battlepass example](https://external-preview.redd.it/A_kntktahdEtxCrhhICgZ0WCl4cec91XnOLjKsKu_kk.jpg?auto=webp&s=79f8f26e28f87a9b3b0e463803e3ceecf49e60ed)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/s34en2/a_legacy_battle_pass_system_like_in_halo_and/)

There are now Legacy Passes. This is a "recent" type of battleass system implemented by 343 in Halo Infinte as a way to appease their players for a poor release.

- Every Overwatch 1 item has been removed from the shop and is in 6 new legacy passes that each cost $10.
- Overwatch 2 passes enter the legacy pass shop after 1 year.
- Only one Legacy Pass can be active while the seasonal pass is active.
- You cannot earn Prestige Pass rewards from legacy passes.

### New Cosmetic Rewards

With the requirement to match the level of cosmetics from Overwatch 1 per Battlepass tier, more cosmetics are required to fulfill that need.

#### Expanded Title Customization

- Actual Text Content
- Materials
  - Common: White, Black, Red, Green, Blue
  - Rare: Gradient and RGB color wheel (Choose your own color)
  - Epic: Metal, Emissive

#### New Name Card Backgrounds

Animated backgrounds and hero speficic name cards. Some could even be glowing etc.

#### Battle Portraits

![Apex Legends Banner Example Image](../../../../img/ApexLegends_Watson_Banner.PNG)

- 2 possible directions
  - Scoreboard:
    - Allow the portrait to the right of the scoreboard to change depending on selected player in match.
  - Quick Career Profile:
    - Popup when selecting a player's name card.

## Redefining Player Engagement Systems

### Clans

In 2022, there was a leak on a Russian PTR Server of an image with a "CLAN C9" underneath their battle tag. In Hindsight, it looks as though Titles have overtaken their place, but developers had confirmed in the past that there was a "new social system: clans" being worked on.

Hopefully we can see an update or event release near the end of 2023.

### Faction Missions

Replace Daily and Weekly challenges with "missions" from a faction. Either Talon or Overwatch and menu aestetics change depending on the faction.

[![Hero Factions Example Image](../../../../img/Talon_daily_missions.png)](https://youtu.be/fEMef4--7uE)

There can be a global board that shows the amount of faction challenges completed for each faction, showing off how much of the world is supporting Talon vs supporting Overwatch.

More Factions can be added as more characters are added to the game for instance:
- Shimada Crime Family Syndicate
- Neutral Junker Gladiators

### Name Card Challenges

Add hero specific difficult challenges with a wealth of rewards for long-term goals.

[![Hero Challenges Example Image](../../../../img/overwatch_hero_challenges.png)](https://youtu.be/fEMef4--7uE)

### In-Game Menus

These would be playable menu screens essentially. 
Season 4 would have been on board the Star Watch Horizon Lunar Colony ship and taking orders from The Galactic Empeorer himself, Sigma.
Season 3 would have been played on Hanamura with the cherry blossom trees, and Season 2 would have been on the ruins map of ilios taking orders from Zeus herself.

## More Player Information

### New Aftermath Screen

After being eliminated in Overwatch, there are many times where it is not entirely clear as to how you died. Assists will popup in the kill feed next to the icon of the player who dealt the final blow, but it is not clear whether you were being healed or damaged by another player at the same time.

![Apex Legends Aftermath screen](https://answers.ea.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/87234i13225F7BC7490AE1?v=v2)

If Players could see the amount of damage that they were taking over time and every player who participated in their death, then they would be able to have a clear picture of how they were eliminated.

### A Better Scoreboard

![Better Scoreboard Image](../../../../img/Scoreboard_01.png)

### News Reel

With the introduction of the news reel in S3, this opens up massive in-game opportunities for gathering/providing data/information voluntarily from/to real players. 

### Weekly Survey

A survey that players may click on within the News Reel.

"How do you feel about the latest patch?"
- I Feel Good
- I Feel Neutral
- I Feel Bad

"After this patch, how do you feel about the heroes in the game? (You do not need to select every hero, click "next" when satisfied.)"
- *Heroes Icon Display Screen*
  - Clicking on an icon brings up the following checkboxes:
    - Is more fun to play?
    - Is more fun to play with?
    - Is fair to play against?
  - Any additional comments about this hero:
    - Free form empty text box to type a max of 500 words.

Clicking next will display a results screen that shows a graph of every player's answers plotted as a graph. 

![Example Graph Of Survey Answers](../../../../img/playerbase_survey_graph.png)

- x-coord=time
- y-coord=survey answers
- viewing option for whole player base or color coded seperate lines per rank.

After submitting their answers for the day, players cannot change them until logging in the next day.

### Developer communication

A link will be available in the news reel that connects to the latest dev blog.

Daily tweets may show up in the news reel as well.

#### Compensation for severe mistakes

Players will recieve in-game currency (not skins) when a DDOS or otherwise substantial issue arises that affects Overwatch and is out of the players' hands such as server issues, game-breaking bugs (A hero needs to be disabled), or wrongful bans/in-game suspensions, etc.

### Expanded Hero Information

A new page has been added to all Hero Information pages that includes all relating current stats for abilities:

# Balance Update

## General

I would much rather the game recieved no balance updates for a season and instead a massive bug fix/UI update was implemented. My favorite balance changes have been Zarya bubble crack visual FX in S3 and Sombra hack UI FX in S4. Most balance changes have been too miniscule to be excited for or directly damaging how fun the game was. That being said, if I were to make a balance update here are my changes:

## All heros

50 more HP for all 250 and under heroes.
10% increase to ultimate costs for all heroes.

Instead of flat Nerfing all Supports' healing capabilities and Damage characters' Damage capabilities, we instead raise the base health of most characters in the game.
To compensate for more possible ultimate charge generation, we increase the cost of all ultimates slightly.

### Supports

Supports have off-screen-ally icons that appear on the edges of the screen (can be switched on/off/only critical allies in settings)

Supports also can see all allies' health bars above their own (can be switched on/off in settings.)
