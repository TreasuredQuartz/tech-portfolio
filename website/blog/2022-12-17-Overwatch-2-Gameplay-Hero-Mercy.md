# Overwatch 2

## Mercy

### How do you market a gateway character into the FPS genre? 
Designed to be as easy as possible to pickup and get value immedietly without needing mechanical skill, Mercy boasts the ability for anyone to have an impact regardless of previous FPS experience.

### Preception
This perception of Mercy being designed as a hero easy to: pickup, learn, get value out of, etc; perpetuates a stigmatism toward Mercy players and is extended toward other supports as well.
Mercy's *percieved* ability to obtain value without a connection to traditional skill requirements asks a question.
Should support heros be relient on skill to heal their teammates?
The Overwatch Developer team has answered this question with multiple support heros that can *potentially* obtain more value than Mercy through the traditional mechanical skill of FPS games.
When a support player starts to underperform, their teammates will bully them. 
Forcing them onto an easier hero such as Mercy, and if that player continues to underperform then they will be bullied even harder for being a detriment to their team even on the "easiest hero in the game."
