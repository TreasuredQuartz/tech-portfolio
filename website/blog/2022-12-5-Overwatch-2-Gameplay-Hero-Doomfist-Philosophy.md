# Overwatch 2

The long awaited sequel to Overwatch, boasting robust Player-Versus-Enemy (PvE) missions has entered "Early-Access." 
Releasing the Player-Versus-Player (PvP) experience worldwide without the PvE content.
Essentially, Overwatch 2 is a direct engine update to the original and a PvP format change from 6-Players-Versus-6-Players (6v6) to 5-Players-Versus-5-Players (5v5).
The original intention behind the transition from 6v6 to 5v5 was *Queue Times*, *Individual Agency*, and *Visual Clutter*.
Amoung the many different systematic, role-specific, and individual hero changes established between the original Overwatch and the sequel; One hero in particular was moved to a different role.
This character was: Doomfist.

<!--truncate-->

### Introduction

Doomfist resided amongst the Damage roster alongside other characters such as Hanzo, Widowmaker, and the newly released hero: Sojourn.
The trifecta of

- Tank, 
- Damage, and 
- Support

that constantly persevere through video games has been long established since before the beginning of Overwatch 1 and were extended at it\'s conception.
Each of these roles have preestablished abilities and playstyles that correspond to their parented job titles: 

- Tanking Damage, 
- Dealing Damage, and 
- Supporting Teammates.

With the format change from 6v6 to 5v5, the Tank role was given compensation-- for their now missing partner-- resulting in a single "Super Tank."
              
## DPS Doomfist

> During his presentation, Overwatch lead designer Geoff Goodman called Doomfist, with his unique, melee-focused combat, an "ode to the fighting genre," and the concept art for the character was a direct homage to fighting game art.[^1]

The lead designer of Overwatch 1 wanted Doomfist to be like a fighting game character inside of an "FPS Hero Shooter" (Overwatch) Genre. 
This release conception of the "Fighting-Game-Combo" character had abilities that excelled in combination with each other.
By utilizing his "Seismic Slam" and "Uppercut" he can set himself up for his "Primary" shotgun or his "Power Punch" for a lot of targeted burst damage.
This intentionally created a "Glass Cannon" or "All-In" type character in which Doomfist would often recieve a "guaranteed" kill if he commited, but be left defensless with his abilities on cooldown.
Unaware players likely would fall prey to Doomfist\'s fully-charged "Power Punch" but this playstyle was not maintained due to the ease of tools given to the rest of the roster.
              
### DPS issues

Doomfist\'s large hitbox (Larger than the Tank hero Zarya) and small health pool (50 HP more than a normal Damage roster hero) allowed other players generous opportunities to "shut down" an enemy Doomfist.
As time passed and players began to learn Doomfist and how to react to an enemy Doomfist, a common play style began to emerge.
A combination of a loud, slow-movement, and slow charge-up time for "Power Punch" and: a loud casting, and time-in-air damage-ramp-up for his slam created a high altitude assassination playstyle.
This playstyle covered his weaknesses by reducing the amount of warning enemy players were given and required the enemies to remain unaware of his incoming air-strike.
- Successfully landing on a non-tank character would deal around (at max. air-time) half the character(s)\' hp as damage (~45 - 125), 
- allowed a "Primary" shotgun fire before then using "Uppercut" (50), 
- and reducing the remaining hp to zero with more "Primary"s 
- before using "Power Punch" to immedietly dash away from the enemy team.

#### Counter-swapping required

Uncoordinated teams and unaware players would suffer from this playstyle and be confused as to the "counter-play" the devlopers intended for Doomfist.
The culmination of Doom\'s ability focused playstyle, large hitbox, and small health pool lead to large spread weapons and Stuns potentially removing the hero and his value from the match.
Developer intentions are clear that Overwatch 1 was a game centered around the capability to swap characters mid-match and that some characters would be more effective against others, but the playerbase contained One-Trick-Players (OTPs).
Even in specific situations: 
- when the entire enemy team would swap characters to "counter" Doomfist, players would not swap off of the character.
- Vice versa, the enemy team would refuse to swap to a "counter" to the Doomfist player.
              
## Tank Doomfist

Overwatch 2 gave the developers a new oppurtunity to rebalance characters with drastic changes including the movement from a Damage role to a Tank role. 

>“Doomfist is a combo hero, taking a page out of fighting games. We want to keep that feeling while moving him to the tank role,” explains Goodman.[^2]

With the transition from Damage to Tank, Doomfist has traded his high burst damage capability for a more consistent damage output and higher survivability.
This includes 200 more Health (Just under Zarya and more in-line with similar big hitbox characters IE: Tanks) and a weaker Power Punch that is faster, has more knockback, and can hit multiple players at once (Multi-Punch).
His "Uppercut" was replaced with "Power Block" and applies damage mitigation to *most* frontal damage and charges his next Power Punch to be doubled in most capabilities.
Seismic Slam was also overhauled to be much more mobile and consistent of an ability, sporting a larger damage range, but less damage. 
While Doomfist cannot inherently One-Shot-Punch anymore, utilizing "Power Block" will allow Doomfist to deal heavy damage to enemies and stun them for one second. 
This will kill half-health non-Tank heros, and allow a small time frame for well-placed follow-up shots on survivors.

### Tank playstyle

> While his new positioning and combos require more finesse to manage, he has transformed into a more approachable, free-flowing, and impactful tank—all while feeling familiar to current Doomfist players.[^2]

Tank Doomfist has become without a doubt the most burst-mobility-based tank in Overwatch 2. 
By comboing his "Power Punch" and new Seismic Slam, Doomfist can leave spawn and land on the objective in most maps.
Doomfist can also Slam the enemy team then use his passive generated Overhealth to buy time to charge a Power Punch to then knockback the enemy team and regenerate the Overhealth potentially lost in that time.
His Power Block serves as a "stall" ability that allows him to wait for his cooldowns to come back, and possibly "parry"

> “When you block a hard-hitting attack, you get powered up instantly. It almost feels like a parry,” says Goodman.[^2]

incoming abilities.
This does not sound that diverse of a "combo" list for a "combo" based character.
His combo includes using Power Punch and then Slam or vise versa with Power Block to wait for Slam\'s cooldown back, block a major ultimate, or get a cheeky Empowered Punch off spam damage.
With the addition of allowing each of his abilities to be canceled with another, this makes him even less of a "combo" character: exchanging 2 abilites for 1 better ability.

### Tank Issues

#### Complaints

As should be expected, many Doomfist players have been upset by this loss of endorphine rush created by his former One-Shot-Punch, as well as the "Bread-And-Butter" Slam, Uppercut combo.
Unbeknownst to a newcomer, Power Punch has retained its signature One-Shot-Punch capability. As described above, the developers have reworked the ability to require more skil and give more output on success.
This raising of the "Skill-floor" of the character creates a more difficult barrier of entry to the hero for both original DPS Doomfist players, newcomers to Overwatch as a whole, and the FPS genre.
Hiding value behind "skill-walls" is not inherently bad. This gives players a tangible "goal" and prevents a mentality of believing certain heros outclass the rest of the roster by virtue of existance.

#### Compared to other tanks

The new Power Block ability does not compare well to other Tanks\' defensive ability(ies):

- Reinhardt has a barrier that mitigates 100% of damage, has a large area that it blocks, but also cannot perform other actions. Barrier functions off a regenerating health pool and has no cooldown until broken. He is also slowed for its duration.

- Zarya has two barriers that last a set time, have a set pool of health, can be projected onto teammates, increase her damage when attacked, mitigate 100% of damage recieved, and cleanse negative debuffs. Duration is short and Cooldown is long, but two charges can be stored at a time and she can perform other actions while using it.

- Winston has a barrier that mitigates 100% of damage, is dome shaped and deployed so it can block areas off, it has a long cooldown and Winston can perform actions while the barrier is deployed. The barrier also has a set health pool and will break.

- Roadhog has Take-A-Breather which restores 350 health, and provides 50% damage mitigation to himself. Roadhog can be stunned out of his ability, and moves slower.

- Wrecking-ball has Adaptive Shields which generates 100 overhealth + 100 additional health per enemy within radius (Max 600 - 700 with B.O.B), cannot be stunned out of it, and he can still perform actions during it. Has a long duration and a longer cooldown.

- D.Va has Defense-Matrix which deletes projectiles that are in her field-of-view, she can activate other abilities during it but cannot use her weapon, has a short duration and a shorter cooldown. Can also be inturrupted.

- Sigma has a projected barrier that he can deploy that functions like Winstons barrier and Reinhardts barrier. The barrier has no cooldowns until broken and can be withdrawn after deployment. He also has Kinetic Grasp that functions similar to D.Vas Defense Matrix, but has a longer duration, even longer cooldown, and generates Overhealth.

- Orisa has Fortify which negates all kncokback and stun effects, while also removing Headshot damage, generating 125 Overhealth on activation, grants 40% damage mitigation, and lets Orisa shoot her gun longer. Has a short duration and a long cooldown. Orisa also has Javelin spin which functions like D.Vas Defense Matrix but also negates melee damage, deals melee damage, and applies a movement buff to her. Has a very short duration and a long cooldown.

- JunkerQueen has Commanding Shout which provides 200 Overhealth, 50 Overhealth for teammates within range, and provides a movement speed buff to self and teammates. Has a short duration and a very long cooldown. She also can perform other actions during its duration.

- Ramattra has a deployable barrier that functions like Winstons barrier once deployed. Has a short duration and a very long cooldown. Also has Nemesis form, which grants 150 armor, and unlocks access to Block which negates 50% of incoming frontal damage (Stacks with armor for 80%), and slows during usage, but can be interrupted (No cooldown or duration on Block). Has a long duration and a long cooldown.

Doomfist Power Block mitigates 80% of *most* frontal damage. Doom cannot perform other actions during it and he can be inturrupted. He also slows himself for the duration which is short and the cooldown is long. After blocking enough damage his next Power Punch will be Empowered (doubled properties).

#### Stealth nerfs

Seismic Slam has become more consistent and has a larger area of effect, although a vastly lower amount of damage. 
This is a very clear nerf to the previous ability. Originally, the ability was much smaller and targeted, bounced enemies toward Doom, and required high altitude for more damage creating "map-dependent" and "map-knowledge" slams.
The larger radius draws more enemy aggression (agro), alerting the majority of the enemy team to Doom's position, which is a fantastic Tank ability (Drawing agro) and giving Overhealth per enemy damaged according to his passive.
This ability would be incredible for a Tank character, if they had the health and armor to sustain the complete focus fire of the enemy team, but Doomfist has not been reworked to sustain damage like a Tank character.

Unfortunately, Doomfist retained his Overwatch 1 passive values, giving him 30 Overhealth per enemy hit up to a maximum of 150 Overhealth. 
This rework is a stealth nerf to Doomfist\'s passive in that removing his "Uppercut" and replacing it with a non-damaging ability has taken away from his Overhealth-Per-Second (OHPS) generation.
"Power Punch"\'s rework to include "Multi-Punch," may possibly make-up for the OHPS lost with his Uppercut transaction to Power Block, but he still is missing a third OHPS generation ability.
When talking about Doomfist\'s passive ability, it seems to be time to bring up the bug in the room:

#### Bug Issues and Inconsistency

Seismic Slam registration bugs...
>- Seismic Slam can be blocked by player bodies[^3]
>- Seismic Slam is like Swiss Cheese and has random holes all throughout it[^3]
>- Seismic Slam can be blocked by corners[^3]

Power Block damage mitigation inconsistency...
>- Damage Ignoring Power Block[^3]
>- Damage ‘Bouncing’ off and/or Phasing through Power Block[^3]

Developer miscommunication or logic failure...
> Power Block is Doomfist’s one and only defensive ability and for some reason operates very inconsistently when blocking damage. This is a bit of a combo issue as it is due to various bugs alongside the very unclear intentions of the developers on what can and cannot be blocked. A large majority of things that should realistically be able to be blocked cannot be blocked and some things that seem like they shouldn’t or wouldn’t be able to be blocked can be blocked, it’s unclear and unnecessarily restricted.[^3]

As a "Tank" hero, Doomfist does not have the consistency of sustainability in fights. With registration issues on Seimic Slam alerting the enemy team, and not rewarding damage and Overhealth, Slam suddenly becomes a low-tier ability with near-no-value.
Instead, canceling Slam with Power Block or charging Power Punch becomes much more effective by giving the benefits of a movement speed boost during these penealizing abilities. Slam effectively becomes a long cooldown to negate Doom's slow movement speed during his other two abilities.
Power Block looks and sounds like a great defensive ability, if there wasn't unintuitive damage abilities that he can block and can't block.

### Issues conclusion

#### Does Doom have the same identity

Doomfist has lost the identity of a "combo" character from a fighting-style game. The Uppercut was indicative of the *"shoryuken"* (or Rising Dragon Fist) from Street Fighter, but has been lost.
Seismic Slam and Power Block have been reworked into generic abilities that do not speak "Fighting-Game-Genre" style, and the bugs/inconsistent applications of these two abilities make it difficult to definitively say how much Tank Doom is better than DPS Doom.
The playstyles of Doomfist have retained their Damage role "Aerial Assassination" style of riding the skybox and focusing outliers in team comps, as well as "Punch bot" style in which Doomfist stays with his team and brawls the enemy tank.

#### Was the role change necessary

Doomfist was originally shifted to the Tank role because of his crowd-control playstyle and Tanks have been decreeded as the role which is allowed stuns, and knockbacks etc.
The dev team likely also sought a solution for his One-Shot ability that frustrated players on the other side of it.
Finaly, the developers have openly come out to addressing "hard-countering" and it\'s place in Overwatch 2:
> “One of the big differences with 5v5 combat is that we’ve tuned a lot of the heroes in the game, and we’ve made changes to reduce the amount of hard counters that Overwatch has,” Keller said. “We want the game to be a little bit more organic. We want people to have more impact, but we also want them to have more freedom in what hero they’re choosing for any particular situation.[^4]

"Counter-swapping" was a very clear intended mechanic in Overwatch 1, and giving Doomfist more HP (for his relatively large hitbox) and more mobility reduces the "counterability" of close-range spread weapons as well as reducing the lock-out duration for Sombra\'s hack and prevalance of other stuns.
Doomfist\'s abilites, However, have been reworked to contain less CC than DPS Doom. Slightly defeating the purpose of the rework.
Seismic Slam used to "bounce" characters toward Doomfist, and Power Block does not have any CC, but Power Punch does much more CC (Although this was supposed to be compensation for losing damage, not losing a CC ability).

## Solutions

### Other people's suggestions

#### Other people's Uppercut solutions
- Replace Power Block with original Uppercut.
- When activating Meteor Strike, Doom performs Uppercut on his way to space.
- Performing a well timed Power Block results in a "parry" where Doomfist will uppercut.

#### Other people's Power Block solutions
- Power Block to be moved to another input (Crouch) and to bring Uppercut back.
- Power Block mitigates 100% of damage
- Power Block is immune to all CC

#### (Updated) Overwatch 2: Season 2 solution patch

###### Rocket Punch
- Damage range redistributed to be more consistently rewarding for landing the punch as opposed to the Wall Slam.
  - Impact from (15 - 30) to (25 - 50)
  - Wall Slam from (20 - 40) to (10 - 30)
  - Combined damage range was (35 - 70) and is now (35 - 80)
- Wall Slam stun added to regular punch, but subtracted from Empowered Punch
  - Regular wall slam stuns for 0.25s
    - This is closer to a Quality-Of-Life (QoL) change that allows for more consistent follow-up on all heros (Some heros could escape immediately and avoid follow-up)
  - Empowered Wall slam reduced (0.25s - 0.75s)
    - A fairly big nerf to the amount of time for aiming and firing follow-up primary shots. 
- Empowered Punch knockback radius reduced from 4 to 3 meters.
   - Massive nerf to the visual impact/feel and danger of Empowered Punch (Less likely wall slam means losing half the potential damage)

###### Power Block
- Cooldown reduced from 8 to 7 seconds
- Duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds
- Minimum damage mitigated required to empower Rocket Punch reduced from 90 to 80 damage
The combination of lower cooldown and higher duration allows for more likely situations in which Empowered Punch is obtained. This is intentional of the patch, but I feel like this reduces the amount of "skill" required to "earn" an Empowered Punch, resulting in a similar situation to Zarya in that it is easy to walk into damage and obtain high charge. Empowered Punch becoming easier to obtain, but less impactful, defeats the purpose of hiding the extra potential behind a skill wall. Why make Empowered Punch easier to obtain in a single Block as opposed to retaining damage between blocks? Does maintained progress toward the next Empowered Punch too punishing for players who are intentionally not trying to feed him his power-up? By increasing the duration, Power Block has become punishing to players who choose not to damage him.

###### Meteor Strike
- Now empowers Rocket Punch on landing
- Enemy slow duration increased from 2 to 3 seconds
Both of these changes make Doomfist's ultimate more impactful and in-line with setting up potential follow-up, as well as dangerous to be targeted by. This also helps close the skill-gap required to earn Empowered Punch (Which seems not unhealthy at first glance.)

###### The Best Defense...
- Maximum temporary health increased from 150 to 200 health
- Temporary health gained per target hit with abilities increased from 30 to 40 health
This change is extremely welcome, but with the continued persistence of Slam Registration bugs, it is difficult to judge whether he needed the extra generation per ability. The maximum temporary health increase was excellent at a glance.

### My suggestions

###### Rocket Punch
Removing the One-Shot potential of Punch was a necessary evil. Multi-Punch was also a good way to justify the redistribution of damage, and focus the "skill" of the ability closer to hitting close groups as opposed to loners. One of my favorite patches to Overwatch 1 included a change to the direction that Rocket Punch generated velocity (Multidirectional Punch). Multidirectional Punch generates an additional "skill ceiling" dimension to the ability, and forms a "skill-consistency" with the highly-skilled, map-knowledge, and position-based "Diagional Punch" ability. Diagional Punch involves the expliotation of map-geometry to force a "ledge" slightly below or above the hitbox of Rocket Punch creating the relevant upward or downward punch (based on position relative to ledge) while avoiding hitting the wall and stopping the Punch in its tracks. Now exclusive to Overwatch 2, Doomfist also can cancel his Seismic Slam by charging his Rocket Punch (Maintaining momentum) while mid-air; potentially a perfectly timed movement arc to allow a mid-air character to be punched (Which also is extremly skill-dependent).

- Rocket Punch now functions consistently gliding along the ground (Doomfist always maintains a constant height above the ground during Punch, and will not be launched off of slopes. He will still be launched off ledges.)
- Mid-Air Multidirectional Punch 
  - When above a height threshold (Piledriver), Rocket Punch travels freely in the direction the camera is facing.
- When Empowered Punch is available and Doomfist is Fully-Charged Mid-Air Punching directly downward, Doomfist will perform Meteor Strike.
- Empowered Punch will punch Sigma's Accretion, and send it in the direction he is punching, as well as only affect Doomfist's enemies.
- Empowered Punch will punch D.va's Bomb, and send it in the direction he is punching.

###### Uppercut And Seismic Slam
Uppercut was an essential ability reference to Fighting genre style games and the third ability required for a diverse combo-set, but restoring this ability and removing Power Block removes the previous solution for Doomfist\'s "skill-based" build-up for a One-Shot ability. This rework is the least drastic revert to Doomfist's ability kit (As opposed to re-enabling the third ability input to be Uppercut).

- Rework Seismic Slam to deal 50 damage and perform the Uppercut animation on lift off at an appropriate camera dependent angle. 
  - I want current Slam with cancellability, and current momentum when canceled. 
  - The only change would be a straighter beginning upward arc while performing old Uppercut animation (but overall the same movement arc).
- Add knockback to enemies when activated in a similar, but much reduced, arc to Doom's Movement arc .
  - Enemies should be beneath Doomfist, not the same height, after finishing the Uppercut animation.
- Put the ability on Cooldown when activated for 6 seconds.
- Add an additional 6 seconds if Doomfist lands without canceling the ability (Performing the Slam).

###### Power Block
Power Block is not a hated ability by my terms at all and moving the ability to the backward input is another callback to the "Fighting-Game" genre in which characters would "block" when walking backward and performing a "frame-perfect" block resulted in a 100% damage mitigation for that attack. Power Block would be able to grab Orisa\'s Javelin, Hog\'s Hook, Queen\'s Knife and any other projectiles classified as "Melee" for the duration of that "Frame perfect" block.

- Move Power Block to the backward input
- Power Block now "Parries" which mitigates 100% frontal damage and reflects certain attacks for the first 0.7 seconds.
- Power Parry successfully blocking 75 damage, or reflecting a "Melee Projectile" ends the current Power Block and resets the cooldown (Duration cuts in half for each success until 0.0166 seconds. Duration is reset after 3 seconds without Power Blocking or Power Parry fails))
- Power Parry has a 0.5 seconds reflect cast time (Doom catches Hog\'s hook and pulls him, catches Orisa\'s Javelin and throws it, catches Queen\'s Jagged Blade and throws it)
- Power Block mitigates 10% frontal damage after being held for 0.7 seconds.
- Power Block now extends around Doom's sides (More forgiving and consistent mitigation, Less forgiving back exposure)
- Power Block has no cooldown, but Power Parry is always put on cooldown for 3 seconds after releasing input.
- Current Power Block on damaged effects are only played during Power Parry.

###### Meteor Strike
This has been the hardest part of Doomfist's kit to rethink for a better fit for him in his new Tank role. Meteor Strike has been a long standing joke of an ultimate  (ult) ability; boasting a high damage center, but a significant fall-off damage toward the edges. Initially, this ult landed too quickly resulting in "free" kills against no-mobility supports, but as the landing speed slowed and cooldown reduction effects were added, the ultimate slowly became a "tempo" ability that was reserved as a "get-out-of-jail card" that allowed Doomfist to expand all his abilities and then choose to escape the fight or stay with renewed cooldowns (And maybe recieve a kill). Tankfist has tacked on a slow effect while not changing anything else about the ability. Removing the ability from being tied to the ultimate allows it to be weaker overall (although more niche to obtain) but create a miniture arena cut-off from most enemies. Creates division in the enemy team, sets up walls for potential punch wall slams and a relatively safe opening to potentially use his new ultimate without getting cancelled.

Functionality Changes:
- This ability has been moved to a Fully-Charged Empowered Mid-Air Downward Punch.
- Creates a ring of debris (functions similar to Mei's Ice Wall) that is jump height (must be climbed over, too high to Hook or Javelin Doomfist inside.), and has a radius around the total area affected.
- Now Pins heros underneath Doomfist (intended for Mid-Air opponents)
- Ability Cooldown reduction removed.
- No longer considered an ultimate
- No longer has a cast time
- Continues until landed, death, or maintaining the same location for at least 0.5 seconds.
- Enemies are now grounded instead of slowed

Statistic Changes:
- Enemies are grounded for 4 seconds.
- Enemies in the Inner Ring are knocked down for 0.75 seconds.
- Damage:
  - Inner Ring: 120
  - Outer Ring: 60
- Falloff range: 2 - 8 meters.
- Area-Of-Effect: 
  - Inner Ring: 2 meters
  - Outer Ring: 6 meters
  - Overall Diameter: 8 meters

###### ...Is The Best Offense.
Doomfist's new ultimate ability is named in referrence to his passive ability "The Best Defense..." and seeks to provide the previous functionality of Meteor Strike without taking him out of the fight, maintaining his ability tempo, and giving him a chance to be stunned while offering a higher sense of participation in the team fight.

- Can be cancelled during cast time, but cannot be cancelled afterward.
- Cast time is 0.9 seconds.
  - "Come at me!"
  - Grants Empowered Punch after casting
  - Passive Overhealth generates at 100 health per 0.1 seconds
    - Does not decay during cast time.
  - Cannot move or perform abilities during cast (maintains momentum)
  - Can activate to cancel other abilities
- Duration is 11 seconds.
- While Doomfist has Overhealth during his ultimate:
  - Doomfist’s ability cooldown rates are accelerated by 100%.
  - Rocket Punch charges 50% faster and abilities deal 50% more damage.
- Passive Changes: 
  - Increases the Maximum Temporary Health to 900 for duration
  - Increases Overhealth generated by abilities to 75 for each enemy hit.
  - Overhealth decay is now 0.1 seconds for duration
    - Dealing more ability damage will reset this condition.
  - Overhealth decay rate is 40 health per second for duration.
