## Overwatch 2

The long awaited sequel to Overwatch, boasting robust Player-Versus-Enemy (PvE) missions has entered "Early-Access." 
Releasing the Player-Versus-Player (PvP) experience worldwide without the PvE content.
Essentially, Overwatch 2 is a direct engine update to the original and a PvP format change from 6-Players-Versus-6-Players (6v6) to 5-Players-Versus-5-Players (5v5).
The original intention behind the transition from 6v6 to 5v5 was *Queue Times*, *Individual Agency*, and *Visual Clutter*.
Amoung the many different systematic, role-specific, and individual hero changes established between the original Overwatch and the sequal; One hero in particular was moved to a different role.
This character was: Doomfist.

## Introduction

Doomfist resided amongst the Damage roster alongside other characters such as Hanzo, Widowmaker, and the newly released hero: Sojourn.
The trifecta of 
-Tank, 
-Damage, and 
-Support 
that constantly persevere through video games has been long established since before the beginning of Overwatch 1 and were extended at it's conception.
Each of these roles have prestablished abilities and playstyles that correspond to their parented job titles: 
-Tanking Damage, 
-Dealing Damage, and 
-Supporting Teammates.
With the format change from 6v6 to 5v5, the Tank role was given compensation-- for their now missing partner-- resulting in a single "Super Tank."
              
## DPS Doomfist

> During his presentation, Overwatch lead designer Geoff Goodman called Doomfist, with his unique, melee-focused combat, an "ode to the fighting genre," and the concept art for the character was a direct homage to fighting game art.[^1]

The lead designer of Overwatch 1 wanted Doomfist to be like a fighting game character inside of an "FPS Hero Shooter" (Overwatch) Genre. 
This release conception of the "Fighting-Game-Combo" character had abilities that excelled in combination with each other.
By utilizing his "Seismic Slam" and "Uppercut" he can set himself up for his "Primary" shotgun or his "Power Punch" for a lot of targeted burst damage.
This intentionally created a "Glass Cannon" or "All-In" type character in which Doomfist would often recieve a "guaranteed" kill if he commited, but be left defensless with his abilities on cooldown.
Unaware players likely would fall prey to Doomfist's fully-charged "Power Punch" but this playstyle was not maintained due to the ease of tools given to the rest of the roster.
              
## DPS issues

Doomfist's large hitbox (Larger than the Tank hero Zarya) and small health pool (50 HP more than a normal Damage roster hero) allowed other players generous opportunities to "shut down" an enemy Doomfist.
As time passed and players began to learn Doomfist and how to react to an enemy Doomfist, a common play style began to emerge.
A combination of a loud, slow-movement, and slow charge-up time for "Power Punch" and: a loud casting, and time-in-air damage-ramp-up for his slam created a high altitude assassination playstyle.
This playstyle covered his weaknesses by reducing the amount of warning enemy players were given and required the enemies to remain unaware of his incoming air-strike.
- Successfully landing on a non-tank character would deal around (at max. air-time) half the character(s)' hp as damage (~45 - 125), 
- allowed a "Primary" shotgun fire before then using "Uppercut" (50), 
- and reducing the remaining hp to zero with more "Primary"s 
- before using "Power Punch" to immedietly dash away from the enemy team.

Uncoordinated teams and unaware players would suffer from this playstyle and be confused as to the "counter-play" the devlopers intended for Doomfist.
The culmination of Doom's ability focused playstyle, large hitbox, and small health pool lead to large spread weapons and Stuns potentially removing the hero and his value from the match.
Developer intentions are clear that Overwatch 1 was a game centered around the capability to swap characters mid-match and that some characters would be more effective against others, but the playerbase contained One-Trick-Players (OTPs).
Even in specific situations: 
- when the entire enemy team would swap characters to "counter" Doomfist, players would not swap off of the character.
- Vice versa, the enemy team would refuse to swap to a "counter" to the Doomfist player.
              
## Tank Doomfist

Overwatch 2 gave the developers a new oppurtunity to rebalance characters with drastic changes including the movement from a Damage role to a Tank role.
