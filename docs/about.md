I reside in the fantasy of driving the future of game development toward player involvment, inclusion, and interaction. Pushing the boundary of intuitive controls and player choice, every time a new playthrough is started for one of my games I want it to be as unique as possible. Enemies, allies, and goals should be determined by the context of the playthrough. In order of importance: Mechanics, Story, then Graphics.

Player actions are the driving force to a game's lifecycle, the determing factor in whether the player enjoys the experience and continues to play versus giving up and finding something better to spend their time on. A game should seek to satisfy the player as well as expand their range of experiences in life.

> Currently working on an example project that can be used to showcase what I value in an experience when I start playing a new video game.
